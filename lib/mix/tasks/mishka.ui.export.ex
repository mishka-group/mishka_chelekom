  @moduledoc """
  #{@shortdoc}

  This Mix Task helps you generate a JSON file from the files in a directory,
  enabling you to use it with `mix mishka.ui.add` or share it in the community version.

  Keep in mind that for each component, you must have both `.eex` and `.exs` files according to the
  documentation of the [Mishka Chelekom](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom) library.
  Otherwise, you will need to create the necessary files manually.
  Itâ€™s recommended to review the Core components and follow their structure as a guide.

  If you prefer to perform the process manually, simply add the relevant option to your command to
  generate a template file. You can then customize it based on your specific requirements.

  **Note**:

  > Use `--base64` option to convert the file content to Base64 if you're using special Erlang
  characters that do not retain their original form when converted back to the original file.


  ## Example

  ```bash
  #{@example}
  ```

  ## Options

  * `--base64` or `-b` - Converts component content to Base64
  * `--template` or `-t` - Creates a default JSON file for manual processing steps.
