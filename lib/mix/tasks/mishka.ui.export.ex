  @shortdoc "A Mix Task for generating a JSON file from a directory of components"

  @moduledoc """
  #{@shortdoc}

  This Mix Task helps you generate a JSON file from the files in a directory,
  enabling you to use it with `mix mishka.ui.add` or share it in the community version.

  Keep in mind that for each component, you must have both `.eex` and `.exs` files according to the
  documentation of the [Mishka Chelekom](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom) library.
  Otherwise, you will need to create the necessary files manually.
  Itâ€™s recommended to review the Core components and follow their structure as a guide.

  If you prefer to perform the process manually, simply add the relevant option to your command to
  generate a template file. You can then customize it based on your specific requirements.

  **Note**:

  > Use `--base64` option to convert the file content to Base64 if you're using special Erlang
  characters that do not retain their original form when converted back to the original file.

  **Note**:

  It is important to note that to place each file in its designated section and specify its type,
  you must use the following naming convention:

  For example, if your file is a `component`, you need to have two files:

  - `component_something.exs`
  - `component_something.eex`

  Similarly, for other file types like `preset` and `template`, you should follow the same
  naming pattern as above. For instance:

  - `template_something.exs`
  - `template_something.eex`

  All files within the directory do not need to have the same name. However,
  they must start with the section name where they are intended to be placed, such as
  `component`, `preset`, or `template`. Additionally, each file must have both the
  `exs` and `eex` formats.

  > **Note**: Since JavaScript files do not require configuration, you only need to
  place the file in the directory. For example: `something.js`


  ## Example

  ```bash
  #{@example}
  ```

  ## Options

  * `--base64` or `-b` - Converts component content to Base64
  * `--name` or `-n` - Defines a name for JSON file, if it is not set default is template.json
  * `--template` or `-t` - Creates a default JSON file for manual processing steps.
